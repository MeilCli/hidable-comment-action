/**
 * visit() will walk through an AST using a depth-first traversal, calling
 * the visitor's enter function at each node in the traversal, and calling the
 * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.
 *
 * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the
 * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of
 * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null
 * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.
 *
 * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and
 * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the
 * visit function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const editedAST = visit(ast, {
 *   enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {
 *     // @return
 *     //   undefined: no action
 *     //   false: skip visiting this node
 *     //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether
 *     //   null: delete this node
 *     //   any value: replace this node with the returned value
 *   },
 *   leave(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {
 *     // @return
 *     //   undefined: no action
 *     //   false: no action
 *     //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether
 *     //   null: delete this node
 *     //   any value: replace this node with the returned value
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively to providing enter() and leave() functions, a visitor can
 * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or
 * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to three permutations of the
 * visitor API:
 *
 * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node of a specific kind.
 *
 * ```ts
 * visit(ast, {
 *   Kind(node) {
 *     // enter the "Kind" node
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of a specific kind.
 *
 * ```ts
 * visit(ast, {
 *   Kind: {
 *     enter(node) {
 *       // enter the "Kind" node
 *     }
 *     leave(node) {
 *       // leave the "Kind" node
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.
 *
 * ```ts
 * visit(ast, {
 *   enter(node) {
 *     // enter any node
 *   },
 *   leave(node) {
 *     // leave any node
 *   }

 *     street: { type: GraphQLString },
 *     number: { type: GraphQLInt },

 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When two types need to refer to each other, or a type needs to refer to
 * itself in a field, you can use a function expression (aka a closure or a
 * thunk) to supply the fields lazily.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const PersonType = new GraphQLObjectType({
 *   name: 'Person',
 *   fields: () => ({
 *     name: { type: GraphQLString },
 *     bestFriend: { type: PersonType },

/**
 * Schema Definition
 *
 * A Schema is created by supplying the root types of each type of operation,
 * query and mutation (optional). A schema definition is then supplied to the
 * validator and executor.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const MyAppSchema = new GraphQLSchema({
 *   query: MyAppQueryRootType,
 *   mutation: MyAppMutationRootType,
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Note: When the schema is constructed, by default only the types that are
 * reachable by traversing the root types are included, other types must be
 * explicitly referenced.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const characterInterface = new GraphQLInterfaceType({
 *   name: 'Character',
 *   ...
 * });
 *
 * const humanType = new GraphQLObjectType({
 *   name: 'Human',
 *   interfaces: [characterInterface],
 *   ...
 * });
 *
 * const droidType = new GraphQLObjectType({
 *   name: 'Droid',
 *   interfaces: [characterInterface],
 *   ...
 * });
 *
 * const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
 *   query: new GraphQLObjectType({
 *     name: 'Query',
 *     fields: {
 *       hero: { type: characterInterface, ... },
 *     }
 *   }),
 *   ...
 *   // Since this schema references only the `Character` interface it's
 *   // necessary to explicitly list the types that implement it if
 *   // you want them to be included in the final schema.
 *   types: [humanType, droidType],
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Note: If an array of `directives` are provided to GraphQLSchema, that will be
 * the exact list of directives represented and allowed. If `directives` is not
 * provided then a default set of the specified directives (e.g. `@include` and
 * `@skip`) will be used. If you wish to provide *additional* directives to these
 * specified directives, you must explicitly declare them. Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const MyAppSchema = new GraphQLSchema({
 *   ...
 *   directives: specifiedDirectives.concat([ myCustomDirective ]),
 * })
 * ```

 * Algorithm:
 *
 * Conflicts occur when two fields exist in a query which will produce the same
 * response name, but represent differing values, thus creating a conflict.
 * The algorithm below finds all conflicts via making a series of comparisons
 * between fields. In order to compare as few fields as possible, this makes
 * a series of comparisons "within" sets of fields and "between" sets of fields.
 *
 * Given any selection set, a collection produces both a set of fields by
 * also including all inline fragments, as well as a list of fragments
 * referenced by fragment spreads.
 *
 * A) Each selection set represented in the document first compares "within" its
 * collected set of fields, finding any conflicts between every pair of
 * overlapping fields.
 * Note: This is the *only time* that a the fields "within" a set are compared
 * to each other. After this only fields "between" sets are compared.
 *
 * B) Also, if any fragment is referenced in a selection set, then a
 * comparison is made "between" the original set of fields and the
 * referenced fragment.
 *
 * C) Also, if multiple fragments are referenced, then comparisons
 * are made "between" each referenced fragment.
 *
 * D) When comparing "between" a set of fields and a referenced fragment, first
 * a comparison is made between each field in the original set of fields and
 * each field in the the referenced set of fields.
 *
 * E) Also, if any fragment is referenced in the referenced selection set,
 * then a comparison is made "between" the original set of fields and the
 * referenced fragment (recursively referring to step D).
 *
 * F) When comparing "between" two fragments, first a comparison is made between
 * each field in the first referenced set of fields and each field in the the
 * second referenced set of fields.
 *
 * G) Also, any fragments referenced by the first must be compared to the
 * second, and any fragments referenced by the second must be compared to the
 * first (recursively referring to step F).
 *
 * H) When comparing two fields, if both have selection sets, then a comparison
 * is made "between" both selection sets, first comparing the set of fields in
 * the first selection set with the set of fields in the second.
 *
 * I) Also, if any fragment is referenced in either selection set, then a
 * comparison is made "between" the other set of fields and the
 * referenced fragment.
 *
 * J) Also, if two fragments are referenced in both selection sets, then a
 * comparison is made "between" the two fragments.
